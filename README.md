# Install

This mod has only been developed and tested on windows, probably won't work on other platform (Is the game can even be run on Linux/Mac even ?)

Also this mod was developed for the 1.0.49 version (ok let me rant a bit, it was developed on previous update but Graveyard update broke some major stuff, i was a bit mad but its okay now, i fixed all the stuff), meaning it will probably break when an official major update drop .

> [!NOTE]  
> Before starting, i suggest to make a backup of your current save file just in case.
> The game save is somewhere at `{user}/AppData/LocalLow/Ved/Megabonk/Saves/CloudDir/{some steam id guess}`

> You can also just copy all at `{user}/AppData/LocalLow/Ved/Megabonk` if not sure

> Make sure to copy your save somewhere in case you need to restore it back for some reason

This mod run with [BepInEX 6 Bleeding Edge Build](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) (tested on the current latest #752):

Start by downloading the BepInex loader [BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.752](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be/752/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.752%2Bdd0655f.zip) in your game directory (Where your Megabonk.exe is). This mean you want to extract BepInEx at something like `{your own path}\steamapps\common\Megabonk`

> [!NOTE]  
> We specifically target the IL2CPP version (.IL2CPP) in the BepInEx build page and also the windows (-win) and the 64 bits (-x64) version of BepInex.

> Not sure if i will upgrade this page every new BepInEx update this how you know what version you should get

> Also i dont know if 64 bits is tied with how the game was built or your system , if the 64 bits version is not working, i guess you should try the 32 bits (x86) version (something like `BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x86-6.0.0-be`)

- Launch the game first at least one time to confirm BepInEx is working (Wait for the main menu as BepInEx need to make some dummy dll). Yous should see a terminal opened along side with the game with some logs in it

- After exiting the game,grab and download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/releases/latest)

- Extract the zip and copy the folder `Megabonk-Together` to the plugins path of BepInEx , something like `../steamapps/common/Megabonk/BepInEx/plugins`

- Launch the game and confirm a new weird `Togther!` button is at the bottom of the main screen

> [!NOTE]  
> The button is not navigable right now, you won't be able to select it with a controller , use your mouse to interact with it (You can pick your controller later)
> Will try to fix later

- Enjoy ! Do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/issues) if you encounter a bug or something isn't working

# How to play

## Random

Play on a random queue, the next 6 players within a time period will get matched together (no pun intended)

## Freindlies

Private queue, Host as to share the room code (copy from the uper right button) and paste it to the players he want to play with

# Known issue

- For some obscure reason, The game crash when loading the map. this is mostly rare and you can just close and restart the game if it ever happen. Dunno why it sometimes crash here ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Not all the stuff happening in the game are perfectly synchronized, like getting money when you shouldn't or ghost item not spawning or whatever. I will mostly be looking for game breaking bug before looking at those

## Linux Support (Proton / Steam Deck)

The mod is fully compatible with Linux via **Proton**. Native Linux support is currently experimental and unstable due to BepInEx 6 compatibility issues with newer kernels (glibc/CET conflicts).

### Expected Folder Structure (Proton)

After installation, your Megabonk directory should look like this:

```text
Megabonk/
├── BepInEx/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── interop/             <-- Generated on first run
│   ├── unity-libs/          <-- Generated on first run
│   └── plugins/
│       └── MegabonkTogether/
│           ├── MegabonkTogether.dll
│           ├── MegabonkTogether.Common.dll
│           └── (other dependency DLLs)
├── Megabonk_Data/
├── winhttp.dll              <-- BepInEx Hook (Critical for Proton)
├── doorstop_config.ini
├── Megabonk.exe             <-- Windows Executable
├── GameAssembly.dll
└── UnityPlayer.dll
```

### Installation

1. **Configure Game for Proton:**
    - In Steam, right-click **Megabonk** -> **Properties** -> **Compatibility**.
    - Check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool".
    - Select **Proton 9.0** (or Experimental).

2. **Install BepInEx 6 (Windows x64):**
    - Download the latest `BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.*` build from [BepisBuilds](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be).
    - Extract the contents directly into your game directory (`.../steamapps/common/Megabonk/`).
    - **Crucial:** You must see `winhttp.dll` next to `Megabonk.exe`.

3. **Configure Launch Options:**
    - In Steam Properties -> General -> Launch Options, add:
      ```bash
      WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%
      ```
    - *This tells Proton to load the local `winhttp.dll` (BepInEx) instead of the system one.*

4. **First Run:**
    - Launch the game once to let BepInEx generate the interop assemblies. This might take a minute on the splash screen.

5. **Install the Mod:**
    - Download the latest release.
    - Extract the `Megabonk-Together` folder into `.../Megabonk/BepInEx/plugins/`.

### Building on Linux

You can build the mod natively on Linux using the .NET 8 SDK. The build output is compatible with the Windows version of the game.

- Ensure `dotnet-sdk-8.0` is installed.
- Clone the repository.
- Run the build script:
  ```bash
  ./build.sh
  ```
  *(This script automatically compiles the code and deploys it to your Steam directory if found at `~/.local/share/Steam/...`)*

- A `Directory.Build.props` file can be used to override the `MegabonkPath` if your game is installed elsewhere.

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <MegabonkPath>/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Megabonk</MegabonkPath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

# Building (Developer)

- Clone this repository
- Set the environment variable **MegabonkPath** pointing to your own game install (something like _../steamapps/common/Megabonk_) for your IDE to know where to get the required DLLs to load for building the mod
- Build the solution

You should now have the macthmaking server built and also the mod file

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The IDE will copy the result mod file in your game directory. This is super practical when developing locally but remember to delete it after.

To target a local server, modify the file `{your game path}/BepInEx/config/MegabonkTogether.cfg` and update [Network].ServerUrl to `ws://127.0.0.1:5000`
